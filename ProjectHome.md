# **yUnit** (Yet another xUnit) #

Expirense of yUnit 0.3.10 usage show, that project is not enought unique. He does not give special advantages in comparison with other unit test frameworks.

I was not able to achieve the main goal - to facilitate the development of a project in several programming languages. So I began to rewrite project from scratch.
